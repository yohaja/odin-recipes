        <br>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 leek, chopped</li>
        <li>2 green chile peppers, chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into thin strips</li>
        <li>½ pound peeled and deveined shrimp</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>3 cups cold cooked white rice</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons kecap manis (sweet soy sauce)</li>
        <br>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <p><b>Step 1</b></p>
        <p>Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Coat with nonstick cooking spray.</p>
        <p><b>Step 2</b></p>
        <p>Pour eggs into the hot skillet and cook until the edges begin to set. Lift the edges to allow any uncooked egg to flow onto the hot pan, about 1 minute. Flip omelet in one piece and cook until fully set, about 30 seconds. Transfer omelet to a cutting board and slice into 1/2-inch strips. Set aside.</p>
        <p><b>Step 3</b></p>
        <p>Heat vegetable oil in a wok or large frying pan over high heat. Stir in onion, leek, chile peppers, and garlic. Cook and stir until onion is soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in chicken, shrimp, coriander, and cumin; mix well. Cook and stir for about 5 minutes.</p>
        <p><b>Step 4</b></p>
        <p>Mix in cooked rice, sweet soy sauce, and omelet strips; cook until rice is heated through and chicken is no longer pink in the center, 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <p>To cook rice: Bring 2 cups of water and 1 cup white rice to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Spread onto a baking sheet, then refrigerate until cold, about 2 hours.</p>
