        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <li>1 pound chicken thighs, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground white pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sunflower seed oil</li>
        <li>24 wooden skewers</li>
        <br>
        <h3>Peanut Sauce</h3>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons peanut butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons kecap manis (sweet soy sauce)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lime juice</li>
        <br>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <p><b>Step 1</b></p>
        <p>Combine chicken thighs, 3/4 teaspoon salt, white pepper, and sunflower seed oil in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours.</p>
        <p><b>Step 2</b></p>
        <p>Soak wooden skewers in water to prevent burning during cooking.</p>
        <p><b>Step 3</b></p>
        <p>Bring water, peanut butter, kecap manis, brown sugar, garlic, and 1/2 teaspoon salt to a boil in a small saucepan; stir to combine. Remove from heat and add lime juice; transfer peanut sauce into a bowl.</p>
        <p><b>Step 4</b></p>
        <p>Thread marinated chicken onto skewers; brush 2 tablespoons of peanut sauce over chicken skewers.</p>
        <p><b>Step 5</b></p>
        <p>Heat a grill pan or large skillet over medium-high heat. Arrange chicken skewers in batches on the grill pan and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Serve skewers with remaining peanut sauce.</p>

        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <p>To cook rice: Bring 2 cups of water and 1 cup white rice to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Spread onto a baking sheet, then refrigerate until cold, about 2 hours.</p>
